üéûÔ∏è Entertainment Web Page üöÄ üçø

This project involves creating an entertainment web page for movies using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The site will make use of a RESTful API to provide a diverse collection of movies and incorporate essential features such as user authentication, distinct pages, and movie saving capabilities. Through this project, I have enhanced my skills in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and improved my proficiency in Next.js authentication and MongoDB integration. Users of the site will be able to browse movies, book them, log in, and log out.
